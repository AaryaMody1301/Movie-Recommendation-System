This is a placeholder file.

For a production application, you'll want to add a movie-placeholder.jpg image here.
The image should be a generic movie poster placeholder that will be displayed for all movies
until you have actual movie posters.

Alternatively, you could use a movie poster API to dynamically fetch real movie posters.
